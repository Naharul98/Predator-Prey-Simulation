- Create an object of the Simulator class.
- Then call one of the following method:
  - simulate(int numSteps) - where numSteps is an int representing number of time steps to run the simulation for.
  - runLongSimulation() - run simulation for a default of 3000 time step.
 
 ## Simulator Parameters
 The parameters for the simulator are listed as instance variable of the 'Simulator' class. To amend the parameters, simply amend the instance variable of this class.
